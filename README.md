A work-in-progress homebrew YouTube client for the 3DS

## Instability Warning

As this app is still in the alpha stage, you may and will encounter crashes and other bugs.  
If you find one of those, it would be helpful to open an issue on this GitHub repository.  

## Description
It utilizes some undocumented YouTube APIs to get the raw video url and plays the stream using the decoder taken from [Video player for 3DS by Core-2-Extreme](https://github.com/Core-2-Extreme/Video_player_for_3DS).  
It does not run any javascripts or render html/css, so it's significantly faster than YouTube on the browser.  
The name is derived from the fact that it is the third YouTube client on 3DS, following the official YouTube app (discontinued) and the new 3DS browser.

## Features

 - Video Playback up to 360p  
   - 480p might be possible and could be considered in the future development
 - Livestreams and premiere videos support  
 - Searching  
 - Video suggestion  
 - Comments  
 - Captions  
 - Local watch history and channel subscription  
 - No ads  
   - It's more like "Ads are not implemented" rather than "We have ad-blocking functionality".  
   Of course, I will never "implement" it :)

## Requirments
* A 3DS (including 2DS and all other models such as XL) with [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) installed and [DSP1](https://github.com/zoogie/DSP1) run.
* I haven't tested the minimum system version, but at least 8.1.0-0

## FAQs

 - Q: Does it make sense?  
   A: The **worst** question in the console homebrew scene. Isn't it just exciting to see your favorite videos playing on a 3DS?

## Building
You need:

 - devkitPro with devkitARM r58  
 - ```3ds-zlib``` and ```3ds-mbedtls``` installed in portlibs of devkitPro  
   You can install it by opening devkitPro msys2 and typing ```pacman -S [package name]```.

Type ```make``` (if you are on Linux) or ```make all_win``` (if you are on Windows) to build it.  

 - Building of dependency libraries(optional)  
   For ffmpeg, libbrotli, and libcurl, follow built.txt in each directory  
   For libctru, just type ```make``` in library\libctru\source\libctru

  Needless to say, the video playback functionality is essential for this app, and it would not have been possible to develop this software without him spending his time optimizing the code sometimes even with assembly and looking into HW decoding on the new 3DS.
